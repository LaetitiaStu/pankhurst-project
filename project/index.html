            <h3>Emmeline Pankhurst's Life</h3>
            <p>
              British political activist who organised the UK suffragette
              movement and helped women win the right to vote. In 1999, Time
              named her as Emmeline Pankhurst was a one of the 100 Most
              Important People of the 20th Century, stating that "she shaped an
              idea of objects for our time" and "shook society into a new
              pattern from which there could be no going back". She was widely
              criticised for her militant tactics, and historians disagree about
              their effectiveness, but her work is recognised as a crucial
              element in achieving women's suffrage in the United Kingdom. Born
              in the Moss Side district of Manchester to politically active
              parents, Pankhurst was introduced at the age of 14 to the women's
              suffrage movement. She founded and became involved with the
              Women's Franchise League, which advocated suffrage for both
              married and unmarried women. When that organisation broke apart,
              she tried to join the left-leaning Independent Labour Party
              through her friendship with socialist Keir Hardie but was
              initially refused membership by the local branch on account of her
              sex. While working as a Poor Law Guardian, she was shocked at the
              harsh conditions she encountered in Manchester's workhouses.

            <p>
              In 1903, Pankhurst founded the Women's Social and Political Union
              (WSPU), an all-women suffrage advocacy organisation dedicated to
              "deeds, not words". The group identified as independent from – and
              often in opposition to – political parties. It became known for
              physical confrontations: its members smashed windows and assaulted
              police officers. Pankhurst, her daughters, and other WSPU
              activists received repeated prison sentences, where they staged
              hunger strikes to secure better conditions, and were often
              force-fed. As Pankhurst's eldest daughter Christabel took
              leadership of the WSPU, antagonism between the group and the
              government grew. Eventually, the group adopted arson as a tactic,
              and more moderate organisations spoke out against the Pankhurst
              family.
